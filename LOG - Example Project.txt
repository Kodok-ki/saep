==================
-Due to the Unity update: the terrain textures had an ugly shine appended to it. Fixed by setting 'Reflection Probe Usage' to 0 in the debug menu
 (for Terrain).
-Had to 2 kinds of errors appear when I tried playing what I'd made:
 1. Speedtree materials needed to be regenerated. Easily fixed at the click of a button
 2. The shader of the water prefab used for the lake constantly generated "Missing property" errors due to the Unity update the water was replaced
    with the pro version which fixed it.
-CPU maxed out (Ryzen 1700 at base clock!!) so auto-bake had to be turned off 

10/07/2017
==================
-Started to fix implementation of double jump.
 -Started by resetting the code to what was included in the Standard Assets (plus implementations of collision used for 'picking' items up)

11/07/2017
===================
-Found the start of the 3rd person char. movement 'pipeline'. Starts in ThirdPersonUserControl.cs which does a call of Move()...
 EDIT(26/07/17): ...in FixedUpdate() i.e. every fixed framerate frame.
-Labelled ThirdPersonUserControl.cs with the next step?

26/07/2017
===================
-Implemented initial draft of airJump() which currently allows players to jump in the air (infinitely) in the direction of the initial jump.
-Next step is to focus on limiting to only two jumps before allowing the 2nd jump to be in the direction of the camera (i.e. allow direction
 change with the 2nd jump)
 -To start with, a getter for m_IsGrounded was created to send to ThirdPersonUserControl.
 -Might need to move the dJump check to FixedUpdate()

24/01/2018
===================
-Implementing a "ground-checking" method in the 'ThirdPersonUserControl' class in an attempt to finally solve the double-jump problem. i.e. finally using raycasts.
   -Lines 87-96

29/01/2018
===================
-Removed airJump() from ThirdPersonCharacter.cs

30/01/2018
===================
-Renamed "ground-checking" method in the 'ThirdPersonUserControl' class to "CheckforDoubleJump()"
-Changing dJump variable into ability to double Jump

31/01/2018
====================
-Modified FixedUpdate() and CheckforDoubleJump() to fit the new purpose of variable 'dJump'

06/02/2018
====================
-Continued modifying FixedUpdate(), CheckforDoubleJump() and airJump(). Resulted in only a single jump as opposed to a double or infinite jump.
	Need to test for execution of line where input of "Jump" button is asked for. Ask for input likely needs to be shifted to Update().

08/02/2018
====================
-Still working on double jump problem.

12/02/2018
====================
-Still working on double jump problem.
-Added a new bool field in 'ThirdPersonCharacter.cs' called 'doublejumped' (might require renaming)
	-Check for the field 'doublejumped' included in the 'HandleGroundMovement()' method.
-CheckforDoubleJump() in 'ThirdPersonUserControl.cs' is now a simple method that checks whether or not the player is on the ground. Thus, method requires renaming.
	-Changed Update() so that input is conditional for single and double (air) jumps. Not sure if necessary.
-Successful double jump. Still buggy, requires actual physics for the 2nd jump to replace the dummy vector put in place for testing.

13/02/2018
====================
-Leaving 'ThirdPersonCharacter.doubleJumped' alone


16/02/2018
====================
-Fixing double jump physics.
-Jumping procedure works purely through the airJump() method. Discovered through debugging. 
-Double jump fails when applied jumping vector is upwards of (x, 30, 30).
	-Double jump succeeds very infrequently when trying to multiply the jump direction 	
-The conditionals in 'ThirdPersonUserControl.cs' are confirmed to be necessary.
-Air jump now proceeds in direction of main camera (m_CamForward).
	-Need to update animator so that the player character turns when an air jump is performed from a standing jump


19/02/2018
====================
-Animation fixes for double jumping put on hold. Focusing on other parts.
-Changed the input for airJump() to use a composition of the m_Move vector and the Vector3.up vector so that players can change their jump distance
 based on how much the direction key is pressed down (using GetAxis() to read input).
-Attempted to implement a sprinting feature by adding a boolean in 'ThirdPersonUserControl.cs' and carrying it through the Move() methods.
	-The m_Move vector gets normalised so needs to be changed.
	-Change implemented. m_Move vector is still normalised but then multiplied afterwards.
-Made use of the debug log to confirm that the correct 'sprinting' input in passed through in 'ThirdPersonUserControl.cs'
	-Again, using the debug log, can confirm the 'move' Vector3 is properly multiplied when the Shift key is held down and when it is not.
	 Therefore, the changes required are from the animation method onwards.

20/02/2018
====================
-The animation controls are perfectly fine unless I require additional animations for sprinting which I will not implement.
-Change required to implement sprinting was simply multiplying the Rigidbody's (m_Rigidbody's) velocity in the Move() method in 'ThirdPersonCharacter.cs'
-Now an implementation of a sprint/stamina bar is required.
-Tried attaching a slider to the player character's position using WorldToScreenPoint() but it moves around too much when the player character moves so
 so settling for a slider in the bottom-left corner of the UI menu. 
	-Or not, by finding the player character's transform position using the script, a fixed position could be set using manual coordinate inputs (in the 
	 Unity inspector) such that the slider appears to be permanently above the player character's head.
	-The stamina script is essentially useless and needs to be deleted.
-Now need to actually implement the slider such that it works with the sprinting feature.

26/02/2018
=====================
-Using a floating point-based stamina system.
-Attached the stamina bar to 'ThirdPersonCharacter.cs' as a public variable and using a max value of 100f.
	-Added UnityEngine.UI and UnityStandardAssets.CrossPlatformInput libraries to 'ThirdPersonCharacter.cs' class
-Created a new method specifically for sprinting (called Sprinting()).
-Through some testing, Move() is confirmed to be called every frame.
-After doing some (minor) testing, I've concluded that the sprint and stamina system has been successfully implemented.

27/02/2018
=====================
-Stamina now recovers faster when the PC is 'm_Rigidbody.velocity' is zero.
	-There's a delay from when the PC stops moving and 'm_Rigidbody.velocity' is actually zero which works as the PC 'slowly catching his breath.'
*Should do some coroutine practice but not sure what to do.
